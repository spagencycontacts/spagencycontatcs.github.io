Why we started - It all started with a simple idea, to create a better way of doing things. we were frustrated with the lack of publicity and social media exposure some businesses were getting and we were determined to bring a new and innovative approach to the table. with a passion for finding solutions to complex problems, we set out to create a business that would revolutionize the industry. we are  a team of like-minded individuals who shared the same vision and together, we set to work on creating an agency that would change the game. After months of hard work and endless researching SPAgency was born and the rest is history.
